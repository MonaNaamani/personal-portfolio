        Thank you for visiting my portfolio!
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm Mona Naamani, a passionate developer with a Bachelor of Business Administration degree in Human Resources
        Management
        from Haigazian University in Lebanon. While my academic and professional journey initially led me into the field of
        Human Resources, I discovered an insatiable curiosity for coding and its incredible potential for innovation. Driven
        by this newfound passion, I embarked on a self-guided journey to learn various coding languages. This journey
        ultimately motivated me to transition from my career in Human Resources, where I accumulated nearly two years of
        valuable work experience, to pursue a fulfilling path in programming.
